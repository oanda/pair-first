Disclaimer
----------
This experiment was created during a hackathon at OANDA. We had fun building it and think it looks pretty slick but we are not proud of the code: we've hardcoded stuff, we've cut corners... we did what had to be done to finish it under a 24h constraint. So we want to stress out that it is by *no mean* representative of the high-quality coding standards normally held at OANDA.
